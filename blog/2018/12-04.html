                <p>It's the end of the semester, so I've been working on quite a few thing, but unfortunately most of them are related to end of the year projects. My big "excitement" this week was getting stuck in a blizzard trying to drive home from Thanksgiving, and having to spend the night in a somewhat sketchy motel in western Missouri. That was fun.</p>
                <p>The main creative thing I've been doing this week is participating in the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018"><i>Advent of Code 2018</i></a> puzzles. Once per day (at 11 PM unfortunately) the daily puzzle is revealed. You're free to solve them anyway you can, and I've been using it as an opportunity to try out some new programming languages. There is a leaderboard, and if you are within the first 100 people in the world to solve the puzzles you get points, but I haven't been paying too much attention to that, considering it's late and I've been using new languages anyway. The highest I've been so far is about 1100. There's two puzzles per day, and I've managed to solve all 8 puzzles so far, although you can tell they're getting harder. The first day and a half I tried my hand at Rust, as I'd been interested in learning it for a while. By the second puzzle of day 2, I decided I hated Rust and never wanted to see it again, so I switched to trying out Ruby. I'm quite enjoying it so far, but if they challenges get too hard, I might switch to Jupyter Notebook or MoonScript, so I can still learn something new while using languages I'm more familiar with.</p>
                <p>That's honestly the most exciting thing this past week. I have one more large assignment due Friday, then I'm pretty much done for the semester (woo). Even though this is a blog about myself, I figured I'd mention a few cool things I found this week. A bunch of Pico-8 developers (more talented than I) came together to make a special <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=32388">advent calendar cart</a>. Everyday until Christmas, a new game unlocks to play. It's a really cool idea, and the games are really well made, day 3 is my personal favorite so far.</p>
                <p>I also found something neat a few weeks ago that I meant to write about in the blog last time. When I was in high school, <i>Tron Legacy</i> came out, and while I'll admit it's a mediocre movie, I found myself really loving it. My favorite scene in the film is when Sam goes to visit Flynn's arcade and Journey plays and all that. At the end of the scene, he finds his dad's old secret office, complete with touchscreen computer interface (from 1989 apparently). I didn't really know what a terminal was at the time, but I was really engaged by what was shown. A user online apparently had the same feelings as I did towards the scene, so they created their own version as an electron app <a href="https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui">https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui</a>. It's visually super cool, and would even run on a touch interface if I had one lying around. It does take a chunk of your CPU, so it's not really viable to actually use, but I was super pleased to see someone actually create something like this.</p>
                <p>And that's it for now! I have a few things I want to work on once my semester projects are finished, including continuing with AoC, so hopefully I'll have more to write about then!</p>
