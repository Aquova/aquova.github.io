            <h3>I wrote a Discord bot<br/>12 June 2017</h3>
            <p>Apparently I can't stay focused on one thing for long. My latest project has been to write a bot for the chatroom service "Discord". The bot, called Aquobot, can read comments posted by other users and respond to various queries or keywords. Currently it responds to about 9 different phrases, but I'll hopefully be able to vastly increase what it's capable of. I've also learned how to host it on my Raspberry Pi so that it can be used contanstly. If you're interested in seeing it work, list the link in the menu or visit my Github.</p>

            <h3>Officially published my website<br/>11 June 2017</h3>
            <p>I am now officially a website developer! (Albeit a terrible one...) I've been wanting to publish my own website for a while without having to rely on Wordpress or some other 3rd party website, so I went ahead and learned HTML and CSS and published my very own website made from scratch! Because of this, the site is rather rough around the edges, but as I experiment with different things it should begin to shape up. Significant changes to the site or any projects I'm working on will be published on this page.</p>
